   <p>How's it going everyone? Welcome to my about me page.This is where you get to learn a little more about me. For starters, let's begin with the thing that I have a true passion for, cars. I have been a huge fan of different styles of race cars since a young boy. I've actually owned 6 classic cars. 5 of which that have been sold and 1 that is in the garage. Outside of cars, I have a passion for music. I grew up in a Church where I would always participate as a musician. The drums became my "instrument" of choice growing up. I enjoy creating rythme, moving the crowd, and adding to memorable times. </p>
